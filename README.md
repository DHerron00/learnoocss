Your goal for this project is to fix the remaining page elements to follow the best OOCSS practices, as well as creating a new section.

Then, follow the instructions below!

	Step 1 - Section panels
		o Create a structure class and a skin class based on the existing styles for the three sections.
			o Hint: it may be necessary to separate the "border" property into its respective parts
		o Apply both classes to the section <div> elements in the HTML file where necessary.
		o Create and apply new classes for the <h1> elements as you see fit.
		o Ensure that your changes have not caused the page to visually change.
		
	Step 2 - Section 2
		o Create a structure class and a skin class based on the existing styles for the lines of text.
		o Apply both classes to the <p> elements in the HTML file where necessary.
		o Once again ensure that your changes have not caused the page to visually change.
		
	Step 3 - Section 3
		o Create or apply an existing structure class for the <h2>, <p>, and <b> classes.
		o Apply the skin class from Section 2 containing Saira to the <h2> element. Modify it as needed.
		o Apply the skin class from Section 2 containing PT Sans to the <p> elements. Modify it as needed.
	Be sure your skin classes work correctly with both sections!
	
	Step 4 - Create a section
		o Create a new section following the same format as the previous sections and using the existing object classes. 
		o This section must meet the following requirements:
			> Contains a new color (try yellow, purple, or orange if you can't think of any!)
			> Contains a banner, a title, some text, and a button. The banner and button should fit the color scheme.
			> Appears visually similar to the existing sections
		o If you've set up your object classes correctly, this section should be easy to create!
